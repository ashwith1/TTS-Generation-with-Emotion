In the village of Elmwick, where chimney smoke curled into riddles, young Lila found a silver key hidden in the hollow of an ancient oak. The blacksmith’s daughter had been searching for iron scraps when she spotted it gleaming—a sliver of moonlight trapped in bark. “It grants one wish,” warned Old Tomas, the bookseller, when she showed him. “But be precise. Magic thrives on loopholes.” Lila didn’t hesitate. Her brother, Finn, lay feverish in bed, his breath ragged as a torn sail. Clutching the key, she whispered, “Make him well.” The key dissolved into her palm, and by dawn, Finn was chasing hens in the yard, grinning. But when Lila tried to cheer, no sound came out. Her voice—its laughter, its songs—had vanished.
