[main] A Baker from the bustling city of Marrowridge and a Shepherd from the quiet hills of Glenbrook were childhood friends. One autumn, the Shepherd invited the Baker to his humble cottage, where they shared a meal of rye bread, goat cheese, and wild onions. The Baker nibbled politely but frowned at the simplicity. [town] “My friend,” [main] he sighed, [town] “you eat like a man who’s never tasted a proper pastry! In Marrowridge, my ovens brim with plum tarts and honey cakes. Come visit—I’ll show you what *real* feasting means.” [main] Intrigued, the Shepherd followed the Baker to the city. The bakery’s shelves groaned with glazed buns and saffron loaves, and the Shepherd gaped at the bounty. Yet as he reached for a buttery croissant, the shop bell jangled. A crowd of customers stampeded in, shouting orders. The friends dove beneath a flour-dusted table, dodding stomping boots. Later, when the chaos subsided, they crept out—only for a stray dog to bound in, snarling at the crumbs. [country] “Enough,” [main] the Shepherd muttered, [country] “your treats are fine, but I’ll take my quiet hills over this madness. At least there, the only stampede is sheep.” [main] And so he returned home, where the bread was plain but the peace was plentiful.
